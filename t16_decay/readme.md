# Physics list for F18 and ion decay

Compare 4 simulations:

1 - emstandard_opt4 and e+ source with F18 spectrum

2 - QGSP_BERT_EMZ and e+ source with F18 spectrum

3 - emstandard_opt4 + decay and f18 ion source with F18 spectrum. WARNING: the decay *must* be set before the physic list.

4 - QGSP_BERT_EMZ (decay included) and f18 ion source with F18 spectrum

In water, to observe e+ annihilation.

The test compares the number of events/e+/gamma (the number of track is different between the two sources).
